# Logical Operators

Logical Operators are used for making decisions in programming based on some other conditions.

AND

OR

NO

### Logical AND - &

---

### Logical Short Circuit AND - && (Optimised)

Short Circuit AND behaves just like Logical AND however, it only evaluates the second express if the first expression yields true.

### Logical OR - |

---

### Logical Short Circuit OR - || (Optimised)

---

### Logical NOT - !

It’s not good practice to use “equals” operator with boolean values.
